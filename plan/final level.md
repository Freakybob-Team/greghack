The user goes to GregChat, which is seized by the government.
Underneath the warning, there's an error code that says "GovSee ended with code /entrance"
If you go to https://freakybob-team.github.io/greghack/game/game.html/entrance, you will get prompted for a lock code. It can be acquired by going into the game's files after starting the final level, and looking at code.txt. Once the user copies the code and puts it in, they gain access the Freemairc GovSee admin panel, where they can type help to see a "erase" command. When they enter erase, and the code they found in code.txt. The panel will redirect you to Bob's profile, except a special version of it. The page reveals he's been behind it all the whole time. The page redirects to a special version of the GovSee panel. The GovSee panel will say "Now you see it. The truth. GovSee was a shame. Push the curtain back, and see the truth." Then, the game redirects to the credits.
# The end.
